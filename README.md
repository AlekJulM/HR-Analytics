# Peoplely - Human Resources Analytics Report (Power BI)

## Project Overview

This Power BI project focuses on **analyzing employee attrition and diversity metrics** at Peoplely.  
The goal is to uncover meaningful insights that can help the organization improve its **hiring strategies**, **diversity efforts**, and **overall employee retention**.

Throughout this report, I developed:

- A **data model** with clean relationships between HR datasets.
- **DAX measures** to calculate key metrics (attrition rate, average salary, diversity indicators, etc.).
- **Three interactive report pages** showcasing insights through intuitive visuals and filters.

The final deliverable is a **clean, branded, and cohesive report** that helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Key Insights

During the analysis, several important findings emerged:

- The **majority of employees** hired at Peoplely are **between 20 and 29 years old**.
- Among active employees:
    
    - **Women** represent **2.7%** of the organization.
    - **Non-binary employees** represent **8.5%** of total staff.
        
- Employees who **identify as white** have the **highest average salary**, while those identifying as **mixed or multiple ethnic groups** show one of the **lowest average salaries**.
- These insights highlight potential **disparities in diversity and inclusion**, offering Atlas Labs opportunities to **rethink hiring and compensation strategies**.

A key question raised during this exploration was:

> “Do our demographic insights impact employee attrition?”

This guided the deeper analysis in the final section of the report.

## ⚙️ Report Development Process

The project followed a two-step approach:

### **Step 1 — Analytical Insights**

- Built relationships across HR datasets.
- Created DAX measures for attrition, salary averages, and demographic breakdowns.
- Designed three report pages focusing on **attrition**, **demographics**, and **compensation**.
### **Step 2 — Visual & Design Enhancements**

- Improved the **visual hierarchy** through consistent titles, colors, and fonts.
- Added **navigation elements** for seamless report flow.
- Applied **branding and layout refinement** for a cohesive stakeholder-ready report.
